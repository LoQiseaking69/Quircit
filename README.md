## Introduction
This project provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for visualizing and interacting with quantum circuits. It is designed to offer an intuitive way for users to experiment with quantum gates and observe their effects on quantum states.

## Features
- Create and visualize quantum circuits with up to 3 qubits.
- Add a variety of quantum gates including Hadamard, CNOT, Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, T, and S.
- Simulate sensor data and observe its impact on the quantum circuit.
- Visualize quantum states using Bloch sphere representation.
- Analyze the measurement outcomes with histogram plots.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
This application requires several dependencies which can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
